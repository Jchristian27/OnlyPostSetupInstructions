    <p class="headercenter">You have now successfully set up your OnlyPost script. Please do not share any of the files in the OnlyPost folder that you have saved onto your desktop with anyone. At this point those files contain your Reddit login crednentials and if you were to send them to someone for any reason or let them read the files for any reason they will be able to see your Reddit username, password, etc.</p>
